## üí° Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### 1. Structured Prompt Framework

#### **The 5-Component Prompt Structure**
```
1. CONTEXT: Set the scene and background
2. TASK: Define what you want to build
3. REQUIREMENTS: Specify technical and design constraints
4. EXAMPLES: Provide reference points
5. OUTPUT: Define expected format and quality
```

#### **Example of Great Prompt Structure**
```
CONTEXT: I'm building a productivity app for remote teams
TASK: Create a modern task management dashboard
REQUIREMENTS: 
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Real-time collaboration features
- Mobile-responsive design
- Dark mode support
EXAMPLES: Similar to Trello but with Notion-style blocks
OUTPUT: Production-ready components with full interactivity
```

### 2. UI-Specific Prompt Enhancements

## üîß Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Context Enhancement
```typescript
// Enhanced system context for AI
const enhancedContext = {
  projectType: 'web-app',
  targetAudience: 'professionals',
  deviceTargets: ['desktop', 'tablet', 'mobile'],
  performanceRequirements: 'high',
  accessibilityLevel: 'AA',
  browserSupport: 'modern',
  designSystem: 'custom',
  interactionComplexity: 'advanced'
};
```

### 2. Design System Integration
```typescript
// Provide design tokens in prompts
const designTokens = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#3B82F6',
    secondary: '#10B981',
    accent: '#F59E0B',
    neutral: '#6B7280'
  },
  spacing: {
    xs: '0.25rem',
    sm: '0.5rem',
    md: '1rem',
    lg: '1.5rem',
    xl: '2rem'
  },
  typography: {
    headings: 'Inter',
    body: 'Inter',
    code: 'JetBrains Mono'
  }
};
```

### 3. Component Architecture Guidelines
```typescript
// Request specific component patterns
const componentPatterns = {
  structure: 'atomic design',
  stateManagement: 'hooks + context',
  styling: 'tailwind utility classes',
  testing: 'jest + testing-library',
  documentation: 'storybook',
  accessibility: 'aria-labels + semantic html'
};
```

const feedbackLoop = {
  visualQuality: 'rate 1-5',
  functionalityScore: 'rate 1-5',
  codeQuality: 'rate 1-5',
  userExperience: 'rate 1-5',
  improvements: 'text feedback'
};
